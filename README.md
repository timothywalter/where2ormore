## About Where2orMore

This is a web app written in Laravel, that has the goal to support churches to start having services of worship again after the **COVID-19 lockdown**. In some countries, you are allowed a maximum number of visitors per service. So we needed a simple app, that allows our members and guests to register for one of several services per sunday.

For more information, and a hosted service, please visit **[Where2ormore](https://www.wo2oderMehr.de)**
